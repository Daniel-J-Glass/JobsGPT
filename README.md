## What is it?

This is a simple python script that will automatically apply to job postings.

## How do I use it?

1. Set up the job posting URL and the location
2. Set up the cover letter
3. Set up the resume
4. Set up the job posting website
5. Set up the job postings you want to apply to
6. Set up the email address you want to send the cover letter to
7. Run the script

## How does it work?

The script will scrape the job posting website for the job posting URL, and then it will use the information from the job posting to automatically fill in the fields in the cover letter. The script will then email the cover letter to the specified email address.
