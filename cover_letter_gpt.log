I am writing to apply for the position of Database Administrator with ABC Company. With my experience in database administration, Microsoft Windows, SQL, and Linux, I believe I am well-suited for this role.

Most recently, I was a Devops Engineer at General Datatech, where I developed an Enterprise Data Warehouse project and built a cloud-hosted end-to-end AWS ETL pipeline from the ground up.

My professional experience includes leading an Enterprise Data Warehouse project developing an AWS ETL pipeline from the ground up, developing hybrid cloud-hosted data warehouses to store and manage sensitive financial data, and developing data retrieval and preprocessing automations with Python to provide analytics-based insights. I have also worked in an Agile/Scrum environment and have experience in working with SQL, NoSQL, Git, Docker, RESTful API, and more.

Most recently, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher and VR Developer, where I used research and development best practices to create more accurate and responsive machine learning models, implemented time series classification models to novel domains, and developed a VR framework to curate experiences. In addition, I have worked as a Data Science Intern, where I created an open-source cloud-based information architecture, managed the dataflow of external and internal data sources, and containerized several open-source utilities.

I believe that I have the qualifications, experience, and enthusiasm to be a valuable asset for General Datatech. I am eager to learn more about this position and discuss how I could contribute to your team. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, 
Daniel Glass

As a Data Science Intern, I implemented a fully open-source cloud based information architecture that saved the company roughly $100,000. My research and development skills enabled me to implement time series classification models to novel domains in a production environment. Furthermore, I have experience with analyzing water chemistry, total suspended solids, equipment operation, and more.

I am confident in my ability to meet and exceed sales budget goals, develop relationships with existing and prospective new clients, and provide technical service support and problem solving. I possess the personal discipline, motivation, and communication skills needed to succeed in a strong team-oriented environment.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.

Sincerely,
Daniel Glass

I am writing to apply for the ScaleFlux Sales position. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and over 10 years of experience in semiconductor sales, I believe I have the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in this role.

I recently worked as a DevOps Engineer at General Datatech, where I led an Enterprise Data Warehouse project to develop a cloud-hosted end-to-end AWS ETL pipeline from the ground up.

I am writing to apply for the Data Analyst position at Cloudflare. I am confident that my combination of technical and analytical skills, as well as my proven track record of success make me a great fit for this role.

I recently graduated from The University of Texas at Dallas with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My education and professional experience have provided me with in-depth knowledge of programming languages such as Python, C++, SQL, and NoSQL. Additionally, I have experience with various cloud services such as AWS, Docker, RESTful API, and Agile/Scrum methodologies. Most notably, I recently led an Enterprise Data Warehouse project developing a fully cloud-hosted end-to-end AWS ETL pipeline from the ground up.

My experience in research and development has enabled me to create more accurate and responsive machine learning models as a Machine Learning Researcher. Furthermore, as a Data Science Intern, I implemented a fully open-source cloud-based information architecture in collaboration with a team of 4 interns that saved the company roughly $100,000.

I am excited to use my skills to help build a better Internet and believe I can be a valuable asset to the Cloudflare team. Thank you for your time and consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Daniel Glass

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist position at Ethisphere. As a computer science graduate from The University of Texas at Dallas and Devops Engineer with General Datatech, I have extensive experience in data analytics, specifically using Python, AWS (Redshift, Lambda, EC2), PowerBI, Matplotlib, Plotly, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, PySpark, Pandas, Numpy, Git, Docker, RESTful API, Agile/Scrum, SQL (Redshift, Postgres, MySQL), and NoSQL (MongoDB).

As a Devops Engineer, I developed an Enterprise Data Warehouse project; a cloud-hosted end-to-end AWS ETL pipeline from the ground up. Additionally, I built a hybrid cloud-hosted data warehouse solution that securely stores, manages, and transports sensitive financial data from key business departments into data analytics software like PowerBI for high-level company executives. During my internship at General Datatech, I implemented a fully open-source cloud-based information architecture that saved the company roughly $100,000 through opportunity costs and licensing. I also used Apache NiFi to manage the dataflow of several external and internal data sources via REST API, normalizing and enriching the data.

I am confident that my skills and experiences make me an ideal candidate for the Data Scientist position. I am excited to discuss more about how I can contribute to Ethisphere's success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
